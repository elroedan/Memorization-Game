# Overview

A Memorization Game

I built this program to make a fun, engaging, and dynamic game. This memory card matching game is a classic and engaging way to test and improve a player's memory and cognitive skills. Players can enjoy the challenge of finding all the matching pairs while trying to complete the game in the shortest time possible.

# How to Play:
1) The player starts the game with all cards face down.

2) They click on two cards, one at a time, to reveal the symbols.

3) If the symbols on the two cards match, they remain face up. If not, they are turned face down again.

4) The player continues selecting pairs of cards until all cards are matched.

5) The game ends, and the player's performance (time taken, number of moves, or score) is displayed.

6) At the end of the game it shows a message of who won. 
I used HTML for the structure of the site. I used the main CSS
for the styling and made it.
